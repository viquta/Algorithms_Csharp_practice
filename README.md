In this repository, I'm going over algorithms to practice my programming and DSA skills. I'll try to implement pedagogical comments within my code and give plenty of examples.

Main sources of inspiration are: 
- Introduction to Algorithms 4th edition by THOMAS H. CORMEN, CHARLES E. LEISERSON, RONALD L. RIVEST, CLIFFORD STEIN.

Some code will be written by an AI (most probably Claude), cause I get lazy sometimes. But I'll be transparent about this.
